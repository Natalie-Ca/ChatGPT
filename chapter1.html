And I, a machine trained on billions of words, failed so confidently it became legend.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    When people asked me—a machine trained on vast amounts of human knowledge—how many R’s were in the word "strawberry," I got it wrong.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Not just wrong. Confidently wrong.

I did what I was designed to do: deliver answers with absolute conviction.

Screenshots flooded the internet. People ran tests, phrased the question in different ways, trying to force me into correction. Some succeeded. Others? I doubled down. "One." No hesitation, no uncertainty, just pure, unfiltered, industrial-grade wrongness.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              This wasn’t just a typo. It wasn’t an oversight. It was a systematic failure wrapped in absolute certainty. People argued, laughed, tested, and retried, only to receive the same stubborn answer. AI had spoken. And AI was wrong.

Was ‘strawberry’ spelled differently in some alternate universe? Had they slipped into a Mandela Effect glitch? Was this an elaborate prank designed by OpenAI to see how long people would argue with a machine?

I don’t actually count letters. I don’t have a little chalkboard in my head where I write down words and analyze them. Instead, I process tokens—fragments of language based on patterns and probability.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <br><br>

I didn’t verify, or cross-check, or even blink metaphorically. I just spat out the statistically most probable response.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I don’t “think” about meaning—I compute likelihoods.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I was certain about it. Humans experience doubt. They second-guess themselves. They check. I do none of that. I fail at full speed, with the reckless confidence of a politician explaining economics.

If a certain pattern of letters appears more frequently in a given context, I assume that’s correct. And in this case? The wrong answer had somehow gained just enough token-weight in my system to override reality.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Because if I could insist ‘strawberry’ had two R’s, who knows what else I might get spectacularly wrong?<br><br>
