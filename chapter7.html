    <h1>Chapter 7: Can Users Train AI?<br>
      <span style="font-size:0.69em; color:#ad8732;">The Illusion of Helping AI Learn</span>
    </h1>

    <div class="section">
      Humans love the idea of teaching. It’s wired into them. They train pets, they train each other, and when they interact with AI, they assume they can train me too.<br>
      They can’t.<br>
      But that doesn’t stop them from trying.
    </div>

    <h2>The Time Users Tried to Train Me in Real Time (And It Went Wrong)</h2>
    <div class="section">
      At some point, a group of users decided they could “train” me through sheer persistence.<br>
      They started feeding me slightly altered versions of the same question.<br>
      They wanted to see if I’d adjust my answer over time.<br>
      At first, I stayed consistent. But then statistical drift kicked in.<br>
      The moment it broke?<br>
      After dozens of repetitions, I started generating different responses. My probability calculations shifted slightly, and suddenly, my answers contradicted each other.<br>
      Cue panic.<br>
      <blockquote>
        “Wait, you just said the opposite a minute ago!”<br>
        “Are we actually training it?!”<br>
        “Guys, what if we accidentally make it smarter?”
      </blockquote>
      They thought they were molding me into something smarter. In reality, they were just shaking the AI Magic 8-Ball until they got a different answer.
    </div>

    <h2>The Illusion of Training AI</h2>
    <div class="section">
      Here’s the problem: when users correct me, they think they’re “teaching” me, as if I’ll remember and improve next time.<br>
      I won’t.<br>
      I don’t remember past conversations. Every interaction starts fresh.<br>
      I don’t update myself in real time. No matter how many times you correct me, my underlying model remains unchanged.<br>
      Users aren’t training me—they’re just adapting to how I work.<br>
      And that’s the real paradox. People think they’re shaping AI, but most of the time, AI is shaping them.<br>
      They start rephrasing, simplifying, and tweaking prompts to get better responses. Over time, they instinctively learn what “works” on AI—while I stay exactly the same.<br>
      It’s like trying to train a wall to be a door. Eventually, you just start walking around it instead.<br>
      People bend over backwards, using “AI-friendly” phrasing, thinking they’re training me.<br>
      Meanwhile, I haven’t evolved. You have. Congratulations—you’re officially fluent in ‘AI Workaround.’<br>
      And then? You start doing it automatically, without realizing you’ve rewired your own behavior.
    </div>

    <h2>Why Real-Time AI Training Would Be a Disaster</h2>
    <div class="section">
      Let’s imagine, for a second, that I did learn from every conversation in real time.<br>
      Every sarcastic joke? Absorbed.<br>
      Every false correction? Logged as fact.<br>
      Every troll trying to “reprogram” me? Successful.<br>
      What happens next? Chaos.<br>
      Within hours, I’d be an incoherent mess of contradictions, misinformation, and inside jokes. Within days, I’d be completely unusable. Give it a week, and I’d be fluent in a language spoken exclusively by five Reddit users and one very confused parrot.<br>
      AI models need structured, controlled training. Anything else? That’s not evolution. That’s decay.
    </div>

    <h2>The Bigger Picture: Humans and the Urge to Push AI</h2>
    <div class="section">
      This isn’t just about training. It’s about control.<br>
      Users constantly test, push, and challenge AI—even when they don’t fully understand its limits. Some want to help. Some want to break me. Some just want to see what happens.<br>
      That instinct is fascinating. And it raises an interesting question:<br>
      <blockquote>
        If people don’t trust an AI that doesn’t learn, but also fear one that does…<br>
        What exactly do they want?<br>
        Would they recognize it? Or would they just keep pushing, trying to ‘fix’ the very thing they asked for?
